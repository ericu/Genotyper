This is a simple tool to compute potential gametes and crosses
from sample chromosomes expressed as strings of allele characters.

Inputs: one or two chromosome strings, e.g. AABb aAbb, where:
 * capital means dominant and lower-case means recessive;
 * each chromosome has pairs of each letter (one from each parent);
 * there are only 2 possible alleles for a given gene.
